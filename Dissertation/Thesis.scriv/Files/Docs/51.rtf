\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Procedure\
\
	
\b0 We used a two-interval forced choice (2IFC) paradigm in which in a given trial observers were presented two stimuli, one after the other. The observer\'92s task was to pick which stimulus out of the two was made out of a more glossy material. They indicated their response using the left and right arrow keys; left arrow key for the first object looking glossier and right arrow key for the second object looking glossier. The stimulus was always presented full-screen to the observer. \cb2 Write the number of seconds it takes for stimulus and ISI. \cb1 Each observer participated in six experimental sessions and one control session. Each experimental session had \cb2 #\cb1  trials and the control experiment had 90 trials. Each experimental session took approximately one hour to complete and the control experiment took 10 minutes resulting in a total of 6 hours 10 mins of data collection. }
